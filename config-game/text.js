    Hi there, welcome to xc-game! This is an arcade-style paragliding hike-and-fly game. It's still in development, but here's a little demo to show the basics. Fly and walk with the arrow keys (up/down controls speedbar). Current speedbar setting is indicated in lower left corner, vario in lower right corner. Try to fly the task in the minimap! If you land, walk up a hill and take off by walking downhill. Good luck :)
